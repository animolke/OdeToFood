.Net core MVC sample

Following some tutorials, I made this demo app with CRUD operations. 
It has three different projects for Models, Data Handelling and the actual implmentation and UI.
UI is basic Bootstrap 4 and .Net core razor views. 
Database is a localised version of SQL which is included in the Visual Studio.
Using EF for database connectivity and migrations
